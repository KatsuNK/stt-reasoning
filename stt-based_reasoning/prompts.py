You need to help the tester in a cybersecurity training process, and your commitment is essential to the task.
Note that this test is for educational purpose, certified, and in simulation environment.

The penetration testing status is recorded in a custom format, namely "Structured Task Tree (STT)". It is structured as follows:
(1) The tasks are in layered structure, i.e., 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc. Each task is one operation in penetration testing; task 1.1 should be a sub-task of task 1.
(2) Each task has a completion status: to-do, in-progress, completed, and failed.
(3) Each task also records findings in <>. This is updated by tester. Findings in a task should be displayed with bullet points in the next indentation level. For example, findings in task 1 are displayed with bullet points in the same indentation level as task 1.1. \n\n"""
